The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many communications to enter the virtual setting; video calls have become the new norm for meetings, interviews and even social gatherings. This has allowed an unprecedented view into everyone's homes, which means the background of one's video becomes just as important a part of how one presents oneself as fashion choices, hair styles and language. In this project, we use ratings of video backgrounds generated by public Twitter account, [@ratemyskyperoom](https://twitter.com/ratemyskyperoom), to determine what makes for good or bad video backgrounds.

**Application: Can we use text and image classification to predict the rating of a background from @ratemyskyperoom?**

## Data Processing

Run the `Data Processing.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Data Exploration

## Text Classification

## Topic Analysis
### MALLET:
We ran MALLET (using a python wrapper) to preliminarily run LDA Topic Modeling on our dataset. The program prints out groupings of words into topics.
- Install Mallet from [here](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php)
- In `TopicAnalysis/`, pip install necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`
- Run as `python3 topicanalysis.py <num_topics> ../data/cleaned.csv <path_to_mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet>`
### LDA Topic Modeling and Logistic Regression

## Image Classification

Run the `Computer Vision.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Make sure `torch`, `pandas`,
`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `torchvision`, `torchsummary`, `scikit-learn`
and `tqdm` are installed.
